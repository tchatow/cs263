* This one was implemented in-place. This lead to some interesting observations
* In rust, a variable is immutable by default. To allow us to modify it inside the swap function, we must add 'mut'
  in multiple places: The declaration, when we take the reference to call the function, and in the function signature.

* Some parts of rust are very similar to C++ - templates are instantiated in much the same way
* Rust allows a lot more to be implied, like OCaml. In both languages types can be omitted as long as the compiler
  knows they are correct within the context of the program.
* Rust follows an imperitive programming style, but is functional in some aspects. For instance, slicing
  is a built in feature similar to OCaml. Instead of writing "return" at the end of a function, the value of
  the last statement is the return value (like OCaml).
* Both languages feature much more strong checking than C++. They know ahead of time whether the code you are writing
  could violate array accesses. Rust disallows multiple slices of an array to exist simultaneously.

* I used this one to practice Rust's matching feature. This lends itself to a very similar program as written in OCaml.
* We can exhaustively check that every case is handled which is useful for verifying the program.

* A lot of methods return an Optional. These need to be unwrap() ed before they can be used. An alternative syntax exists,
 with a question mark at the end of a statement, which either unwraps or returns an empty optional from the function.
* Need a lot of explicit casting - ie. u32 can't be used in place of usize
* Why does f32.cmp take the second argument by reference?
* In the lambda in iter.min_by(), we need to dereference the value twice. Why is this not just once?
